    <h3>
      eduVeRse is a free, web-based application that allows students of all grade levels to learn concepts, collaborate, and explore higher-education through VR experiences – without the need to download any software. Through A-Frame VR experiences and Youtube VR's built-in functionalities, the VR experiences referenced on this website are compatible with mobile phones, desktops, and AR/VR/MR headsets.

      Future Plans
    </h2>
    
    <h3>
      In the future, eduVeRse will have the capability for users to create a profile and upload their own 3D models to share educational spaces with peers.
      <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, we will implement multi-user functionality with deepstream.io so that students and educators can communicate in real-time!
      <br>
      <br>
      Lastly, we will continue to upload more experiences built with A-Frame that feature animations and complex interactions.
